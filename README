Thank you for marking my Assignment-

"make run" 		- will compile and run the program for you with no arguements parsed into it.

"make extract" 	- will compile and run the program and parse in [-x 10 extract]. 
				- this will create a file in the directory "extracted_Images" called extract10.raw
				- the file is just the 10th file in the raw images

"make map" 		- will compile and run the program and parse in [-d 10  20 diffMapFile]. 
				- this will create a file in the directory "extracted_Images" called diffMapFile_10_20.raw
				- the file will be the difference map between images 10 and 20

"make front" 	- will compile and run the program and parse in [-g 50]. 
				- this will create a file in the directory "extracted_Images" called frontExtraction50.raw
				- the file will be a front percpective on depth 50

"make clean"	- cleans the "extracted_Images" directory
